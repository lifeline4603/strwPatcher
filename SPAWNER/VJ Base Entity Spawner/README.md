vjbase is an addon that allows for the creation of scripted npcs through other addons, hence called a base. it adds a few tools and weapons for the player to play around with.

## vulnerability
there is a vulnerability that allows anyone to spawn in any entities by just holding out the tool, completely bypassing any tool permission checks.

fourtunately, there is no fix here, because the most recent version of vjbase fixes this. I recommend updating to the latest version to fix this exploit. if updated, the exploit notification shouldn't appear once you run the patcher.lua again due to the networkstring being different between old and new versions.
