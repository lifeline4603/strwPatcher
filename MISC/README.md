this section is for exploits that are more of just random, and cannot be sorted to any of the existing categories.

if an exploit was marked and is under this section, it may be worth it to quickly take a look at what the exploit does, as it can truly be anything, and I mean it.

## index
below you can find an index of all known exploits under this section
- Hacktool Minigame Skip
- Rogue Scoreboard Hide Name (might be #Accidentally patched?)
